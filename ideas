-outlier detection
    -z-score
    -multivariate outlier detection
    -clustering
    -isolation forest
    -neural network

-audit
    -assumptions about data: filled data (why did you fill with 0?)
    -assumptions about final mode: why isolation forest? present entire research report by comparing explored models
    -explainable AI

-business
    -how to present explainable: make a story with explainable features
    -create graphs from transactions to show an account

-presentation:
    -slide about universe and galaxy
    -slide about how the presentation can help you
    -2 slides about ML: supervised vs unsupervised
    -1 slide about what an anomaly/outlier is + frame of reference
    -1 slide about scores, F1 and cofusion matrix
    -1 slide for z score
    -1 slide for mod
    -1 slide for the clustering
    -1 slide for isolation forest
    -1 slide for autoencoder

    -audit: 3 types (internal - focus on security/protocols/and alignment with others, independent, national)
        -assumptions about data
        -assumptions about model/and why the pick? (is IF making data assumptions, is AE making data assumptions)
        -explainable?
